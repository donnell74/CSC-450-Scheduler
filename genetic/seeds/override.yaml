# This file should be used to specify information about the current
# semester being scheduled. A semester and year should be specified
# (e.g. Fall 2015); otherwise the application will guess.

# Additional information is not necessary and should only be included
# to indicate some deviation from the information included in the
# global input file, 'global.yaml'. For example, if normally a course
# is taught by one professor, but for some reason this course will be
# taught by a different professor only for this particular semester,
# it should be included here.
